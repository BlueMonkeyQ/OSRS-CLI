#### OSRS CLI

*-Depricated*

This project is my attempt to rebuild Old School Runescape in Python as a CLI game. Currently the game features 9 skills, a navigable map, shops, NPC's with interactions, and mobs. 

### Features:
*   9 Skills
    *   HP - Max HP
    *   Strength - Damage range
    *   Attack - Accuracy of a hit
    *   Defense - Chance of being hit
    *   Prayer - Buffs
    *   Crafting - Item Creation
    *   Agility - Map Shortcuts
    *   Thieving - Pickpocket 
    *   Slayer - Task
*   Shops - 4 location based shops with different inventories
*   NPC - 7 location based mobs with interactions
*   Mobs - 7 location based mobs with drop tables
*   Map - 15 route based locations. Each with different mobs, NPC's, Shops, etc...

### TODO:
*   Major Refactor - wrote this on vacation
*   Update UI - more modern looking:
    *   PyInquiry
    *   Rich
*   Add more depth to current skills before adding more
*   More NPC interactions, maybe quest?
